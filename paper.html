West Antarctic Ice Sheet, if all melt, can rise seawater by 4.7 meters

<h2>Background</h2>
Antarctic ice sheet contains 26.5  &times; 10<sup>6</sup> km<sup>3</sup> of ice <sup>[<div class="popup" onclick="r1()">1
  <span class="popuptext" style="text-decoration:none;" id="r1">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_ice_sheet</a></span>
</div>]</sup>. However, only the ice above sea level will contribute to sea level rise<sup>[<div class="popup" onclick="r2()">2
  <span class="popuptext" id="r2">https://www.antarcticglaciers.org/glaciers-and-climate/estimating-glacier-contribution-to-sea-level-rise/</span>
</div>]</sup>. As the total volume of Antarctic ice below sea level ranges from 2.1 &times; 10<sup>6</sup> km<sup>3</sup> to 2.6 &times; 10<sup>6</sup> km<sup>3</sup><sup>[<div class="popup" onclick="r5()">3
  <span class="popuptext" id="r5">https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/7/375/2013/tc-7-375-2013.pdf</span>
</div>]</sup>, the minimum volume of Antarctic ice above sea level equals (26.5 - 2.6) &times; 10<sup>6</sup> km<sup>3</sup>, or 23.9 &times; 10<sup>6</sup> km<sup>3</sup>, which will contribute to sea level rise. The volume of seawater melt from the ice is the volume of the ice above sea level multiplied by 0.92&mdash;the conversion factor for the volume of ice to liquid water<sup>[<div class="popup" onclick="r4()">4
  <span class="popuptext" style="text-decoration:none;" id="r4">https://sciencing.com/calculate-volume-ice-7851671.html</span></div>]</sup>. So, Antarctic ice will contribute 23.9 &times; 10<sup>6</sup> &times; 0.92 km<sup>3</sup>, or 21.988 &times; 10<sup>6</sup> km<sup>3</sup> of water after melting.

<h2>Theoretical Model</h2>
<p>For simplicity, assume that the Earth is a sphere so that the volume of Amtractic Ice Sheet above sea level, after melting, can be conceptualized as the volume of the spherical shell<sup>[5]</sup>. Let's also assume that:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The Earth radius (r) is 6,378 km.
<li>The water volume from Antarctic ice melt (V) is 21.988 &times; 10<sup>6</sup> km<sup>3</sup>. 
<li>The ocean covers 70% of Earth's surface area.
</ul>

<br><br>
<img src="R.png" style="height:45px;"></img>
<br>
<p><br>
where <b><i>H</b></i> is the sea level raise due to ice melt (m); <b><i>R</b></i> is the radius of the Earth after sea level raise (km); <b><i>r</b></i> is the radius of the Earth prior to sea level raise (6,378 km); <b><i>V</b></i> is the volume of Antarctic ice above sea level (21.988 &times; 10<sup>6</sup> km<sup>3</sup>); and <b><i>π</b></i> is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, equal to 3.141592653589793 (Dmnl).

</p>
<p><br>
The above equations can be written in javaScript as follows:

<div class="collumn">
<pre>
let r = 6378;
let V = 21.988 * 1000000;
let pi = Math.PI;
let r3 = Math.pow(r,3);
let R3 = ((V*3/2.87)/pi)+r3;
let R = Math.pow(R3, 1/3);
let h = (R - r) * 1000;
let H = h.toFixed(1);

<h2>Results & Discussions</h2>
<p>The estimated sea level equivant of <b>the Antractic Ice Sheet</b> was (<font color="blue">59.9</font> m), slightly higher than that of the BedMachine (<font color="red">57.9 ± 0.9</font> m) noted in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0510-8" style="text-decoration: none;">Morlighem <i>et al</i> (2020)</a>.
</p><p>
The model shows that only <b>the West Antarctic Ice Sheet</b>, containing 2.1 &times; 10<sup>6</sup> km<sup>3</sup> of ice above sea level (<a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2000JB900449" style="text-decoration: none;">Lythe and Vaughan, 2001</a>), is enough to raise global sea water by about <font color="blue">4.7</font> m, slightly greater than <a href="https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/7/375/2013/tc-7-375-2013.pdf" style="text-decoration:none;">Fretwell et al. (2013)</a>'s finding (<font color="red">4.3</font> m). 
</p>

<p>
<b>The East Antarctic Ice Sheet</b> has a volume of 21.76 × 10<sup>6</sup> km<sup>3</sup> of grounded ice, equivalent to ∼<font color="blue">54.6</font> m in mean sea-level equivalent, compared with ∼<font color="red">53</font> m in <a href="https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/7/375/2013/tc-7-375-2013.pdf" style="text-decoration:none;">Fretwell et al.

            The sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened.  The crowd far away on the left, towards Woking, seemed to grow, and I heard now a faint murmur from it.  The little knot of people towards Chobham dispersed.  There was scarcely an intimation of movement from the pit.</p>

            <p>It was this, as much as anything, that gave people courage, and I suppose the new arrivals from Woking also helped to restore confidence.  At any rate, as the dusk came on a slow, intermittent movement upon the sand pits began, a movement that seemed to gather force as the stillness of the evening about the cylinder remained unbroken.  Vertical black figures in twos and threes would advance, stop, watch, and advance again, spreading out as they did so in a thin irregular crescent that promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated horns.  I, too, on my side began to move towards the pit.</p>

            <p>Then I saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand pits, and heard the clatter of hoofs and the gride of wheels.  I saw a lad trundling off the barrow of apples.  And then, within thirty yards of the pit, advancing from the direction of Horsell, I noted a little black knot of men, the foremost of whom was waving a white flag.</p>

            <p>Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. <span class="citation">"Don't under&shy;estimate the Force. I suggest you try it again, Luke."</span> This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!</p>
            <p>You don't believe in the Force, do you? Partially, but it also obeys your commands. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. As you wish.</p></div>

When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath</p></div>

He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. </p>
					
					<p>His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. </p></div>
